/**
 * The VAT model contains the complete VAT configuration in plentymarkets. The VAT configuration is based on 4 VAT rates. A VAT configuration always belongs to an accounting location. The accounting location is in a specified country and is assigned to a client. One accounting location can have several VAT configurations, but only one is active at a time. Which one is active depends on the startedAt date. This also means that only one VAT number is active per accounting location.
